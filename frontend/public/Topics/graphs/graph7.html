    <h2>Bridges</h2>
    <!--TODO: add a picture-->
    <p>
        A bridge is an edge in graph on whose removal, the graph split into multiple components. We need to detect which edge is
        a bridge. It is done by maintaining 2 vectors:
        <ul>
            <li>dfs_num[n]: stores the iteration count, when the vertex u is visited for the first time.</li>
            <li>dfs_low[n]: is initially equal to dfs_num, stores the least value of node that can be reached using a 
                "back edge". In other words, it consists of the lowest value of iteration count of all adjacent nodes,
                barring the parent.
            </li>
        </ul>
        When we do dfs, if neighbor is visited already take minimum of dfs_low[node] with dfs_num[neighbor]
        because you cannot reach beyond neighbor through neighbor if it is already visited.
        If at the end of this traversal, we have dfs_[low] of neighbor lower than dfs_num of 
        node than that edge is considered an edge, as it was established that it could not return to
        parent via a second path.
    </p>
    <h2>Articulation points</h2>
    <!--TODO: add a picture-->
    <p>Atriculation point is a point on whose removal, the graph breaks into multiple components.
        Concepts used to find articulation point involve similar concepts to bridges. We use the same 
        2 vectors as in bridges, except we declare a node articulation point if the min node,
        its neighbors can reach is that node itself (dfs_num[neighbor] == node).
        Therefore new condition for articulation point becomes dfs_low[neighbor] >= node.
        One more condition that comes into play is if parent is connected to multiple children components, 
        then also it is an articulation point.
    </p>
    <h2>Strongly connected components</h2>
    <p>
        a Strongly connected component in a directed graph is a subset of vertices where every vertex in 
        given subset is reachable from any other vertex in the given subset.
    </p>
    <p>To get all strongly connected componets of a graph we use Kosaraju's algorithm.
